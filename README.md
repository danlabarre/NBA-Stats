Main Files: Game_Stats_Scraper, DataAnalysisNBA, NBAStatsFinalcsv
Scrape NBA data from ESPN and use that data to predict NBA game outcomes .
As of now I have completed:

Created a webscraper for the 2018-2019 season up to the allstar break.
Exported the file and converted it to a CVS file to manipulate with mysql.
Created a data bases for each team from the original database.

Now I created the whole season scraper and am starting to run regressions on my data.
