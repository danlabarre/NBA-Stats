# NBA-Stats
Main Files: Game_Stats_Scraper, DataAnalysisNBA, NBAStatsFinalcsv
Scrape NBA data from ESPN and use that data to predict NBA game outcomes 
As of now I have completed:

Created a single day scraper of NBA games
Edited that scraper to scrape a whole season
Exported the file and converted it to a CVS file to manipulate with mysql

Now I created the whole season scraper and am starting to run regressions on my data
